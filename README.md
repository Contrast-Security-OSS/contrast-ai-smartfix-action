## Legal Disclaimer

When you use \[Contrast AI SmartFix\], you agree that your code and other data will be submitted to an LLM of your choice.  Both the submission of data to the LLM and the output generated by the LLM will be subject to the terms of service of that LLM.   Use of Contrast AI SmartFix is entirely at your own risk.

## Introduction

Welcome to Contrast AI SmartFix\! SmartFix is an AI-powered agent that automatically generates code fixes for vulnerabilities identified by Contrast Assess. It integrates into your developer workflow via GitHub Actions, creating Pull Requests (PRs) with proposed remediations.

**Key Benefits:**

* **Automated Remediation:** Reduces the manual effort and time required to fix vulnerabilities.  
* **Developer-Focused:** Delivers fixes as PRs directly in your GitHub repository, fitting naturally into existing workflows.  
* **Runtime Context:** Leverages Contrast Assess's runtime analysis (IAST) to provide more accurate and relevant fixes.  
* **Early Access (EA):** This document covers the Early Access release of SmartFix.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Contrast Assess:** You need an active Contrast Assess deployment identifying vulnerabilities in your application.  
* **GitHub:** Your project must be hosted on GitHub and use GitHub Actions.  
* **Contrast API Credentials:** You will need your Contrast Host, Organization ID, Application ID, Authorization Key, and API Key.

### Installation and Configuration

SmartFix is configured as a GitHub Action. Add a workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/smartfix.yml`) to your repository following the below example.  A full workflow example is also available at [https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/contrast-ai-smartfix-action/blob/main/contrast-ai-smartfix.yml.template](https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/contrast-ai-smartfix-action/blob/main/contrast-ai-smartfix.yml.template):

**Important:**

* Store all sensitive values (API keys, tokens) as GitHub Secrets in your repository settings.  
* Replace `vX.Y.Z` with the specific version of the SmartFix GitHub Action you intend to use.  
* The `contrast_app_id` must correspond to the Contrast Application ID for the code in the repository where this action runs.  
* **Suggestion:** Setup an API-only service user named “Contrast AI SmartFix” in your Organization Settings in your Contrast SaaS instance.  At minimum, it should have permission to do the “View Organization” and “Edit Application” actions for this application.  This service user’s `contrast_authorization_key` value and the Organization’s `contrast_api_key` value should be used in the workflow.

### Supported LLMs (Bring Your Own LLM \- BYOLLM)

For the Early Access release, SmartFix uses a "Bring Your Own LLM" (BYOLLM) model. You provide the credentials for your preferred LLM provider.

* **Recommended:** **Anthropic Claude Sonnet (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet via AWS Bedrock)**. This model has been extensively tested.  
  * Set `agent_model` to the appropriate model string (e.g., `bedrock/us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0`).  
  * Provide AWS credentials (`aws_access_key_id`, `aws_secret_access_key`, `aws_region_name`).  
* **Experimental:** **Google Gemini Pro (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro)**. Preliminary testing shows good results, but it has not been fully tested for this release.  
  * Set `agent_model` to the appropriate model string (e.g., `gemini/gemini-1.5-pro-latest`).  
  * Provide your `gemini_api_key`.  
* **Not Recommended:** OpenAI GPT models (e.g., gpt-4, gpt-4.1, o1, o3, etc) are **not recommended** at this time, as they have shown issues following instructions within the SmartFix agent.

Refer to the `action.yml` file within the SmartFix GitHub Action repository and LiteLLM documentation for specific `agent_model` strings and required credentials for other models/providers.

### Supported Languages

* **Java:** The Early Access release is primarily tested and supported for Java applications.  
* **Other Languages:** While it might work for other languages, comprehensive testing has not been performed. Use with caution for non-Java projects during the EA period.

### Supported Vulnerabilities

SmartFix for Early Access focuses on remediating:

* **CRITICAL** and **HIGH** severity vulnerabilities identified by Contrast Assess.  
* **Exclusions:**  
  * Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is currently excluded due to the complexity of fixes often requiring API changes.  
  * Other specific vulnerability types may be excluded based on ongoing testing by Contrast Labs.

## How it Works

1. **Scheduled Trigger:** The GitHub Action runs on a defined schedule (e.g., daily) or can be manually triggered.  
2. **Configuration Validation:** The action validates your Contrast credentials and other configuration values to ensure they are valid.  
3. **Vulnerability Request:** The SmartFix agent in the action calls the Contrast backend API to request a vulnerability to fix.  
4. **Prioritization:** The backend API prioritizes eligible vulnerabilities based on severity.  
5. **LLM Interaction:** The agent uses your configured LLM (BYOLLM) to:  
   * Access the relevant code in your repository.  
   * Analyze the vulnerability and surrounding code.  
   * Generate a code fix.  
6. **Pull Request Generation:** The agent creates a Pull Request (PR) against your specified `base_branch` (e.g., `main`).  
   * **PR Title:** Clear and descriptive.  
   * **PR Description:** Explains the vulnerability, links to the Contrast Assess trace, outlines the fix strategy, and prompts for feedback if the PR is rejected.  
7. **Status Update:** The agent notifies the backend API about the PR creation as well as when the PR is either closed or merged.  
8. **Throttling:** The `max_open_prs` input (default: 5\) limits the number of concurrent open PRs SmartFix will create to avoid overwhelming developers.

## Key Features

* **Bring Your Own LLM (BYOLLM):** Flexibility to use your preferred LLM provider and model.  
* **Configurable PR Throttling:** Control the volume of automated PRs using `max_open_prs`.  
* **Build Command Integration:** You must provide a `build_command` to allow the agent to ensure changes can build. Ideally, this command will run the tests as well so the agent can ensure it doesn't break existing tests.  
* **Code Formatting:** If your build requires formatting, you can provide a `formatting_command` to ensure generated code adheres to your project's style. This will be run before attempting to run the build.  
* **Debug Mode:** Enable `debug_mode: 'true'` for verbose logging in the GitHub Action output.

## Configuration Inputs

The following are key inputs for the GitHub Action. Refer to the `action.yml` in the SmartFix GitHub Action repository for a complete list and default values.

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `github_token` | GitHub token for PR operations. | Yes |  |
| `base_branch` | Base branch for PRs. | No | `main` |
| `contrast_host` | Contrast Security API host. | Yes |  |
| `contrast_org_id` | Contrast Organization ID. | Yes |  |
| `contrast_app_id` | Contrast Application ID for the repository. | Yes |  |
| `contrast_authorization_key` | Contrast Authorization Key. | Yes |  |
| `contrast_api_key` | Contrast API Key. | Yes |  |
| `agent_model` | LLM model to use (e.g., `bedrock/anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0`). | No | `bedrock/us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0` |
| `gemini_api_key` | Gemini API key (if using Gemini). | No |  |
| `aws_access_key_id` | AWS Access Key ID (if using Bedrock). | No |  |
| `aws_secret_access_key` | AWS Secret Access Key (if using Bedrock). | No |  |
| `aws_region_name` | AWS Region Name (if using Bedrock). | No | `us-east-1` |
| `build_command` | Command to build the application (for QA). | Yes, for generating fixes |  |
| `formatting_command` | Command to format code. | No |  |
| `max_open_prs` | Maximum number of open PRs SmartFix can create. | No | `5` |
| `debug_mode` | Enable verbose logging. | No | `false` |
| `skip_qa_review` | Skip the QA review step (not recommended). | No | `false` |
| `skip_writing_security_test` | Skip attempting to write a security test for the fix. | No | `false` |

## Troubleshooting

* **Invalid Credentials:** If the action fails with errors related to Contrast authentication, double-check your `contrast_host`, `contrast_org_id`, `contrast_app_id`, `contrast_authorization_key`, and `contrast_api_key` secrets and ensure they are correctly passed to the action.  
* **LLM Errors:**  
  * Ensure the `agent_model` string is correct for your chosen provider and model.  
  * Verify that the necessary API keys/credentials for your LLM provider (`gemini_api_key`, AWS credentials, etc.) are correctly configured as GitHub Secrets and passed to the action.  
  * Check the GitHub Action logs for specific error messages from the LLM or the SmartFix agent.  
* **PR Creation Failures:**  
  * Ensure the `github_token` has the necessary permissions to create PRs in the repository.  
  * Check for branch protection rules that might prevent PR creation.  
* **No Fixes Generated:**  
  * Confirm there are eligible CRITICAL or HIGH severity vulnerabilities in Contrast Assess for the configured `contrast_app_id`. SmartFix only attempts to fix vulnerabilities that are in the REPORTED state.  
  * Check the `max_open_prs` limit; if the number of PRs SmartFix has created that are still open matches this limit, no new PRs will be created.  
  * Review the GitHub Action logs for messages indicating why vulnerabilities might have been skipped.  
* **Incorrect Fixes:** The AI-generated fixes should **always** be reviewed carefully. If a fix is incorrect or incomplete:  
  * Reject the PR.

## Best Practices & Recommendations

* **Ensure the `build_command` Runs the Tests:** This allows SmartFix to catch and fix any tests that may fail due to its changes. It also allows it to run the security tests it creates, if that option is enabled.  
* **Review PRs Thoroughly:** Always carefully review the code changes proposed by SmartFix before merging.  
* **Monitor Action Runs:** Regularly check the GitHub Action logs for successful runs and any reported issues.  
* **Use Recommended LLMs:** For the best experience during Early Access, use the Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.7 or 4 model.

## FAQ

* **Q: Can I use SmartFix if I don't use Contrast Assess?**  
  * A: No, SmartFix relies on vulnerability data from Contrast Assess. In the future we plan to expand to include more.  
* **Q: How often does SmartFix run?**  
  * A: This is determined by the `schedule` trigger in your GitHub Actions workflow file. You can customize it.  
* **Q: What happens if the AI cannot generate a fix?**  
  * A: The agent will log this, and no PR will be created for that specific vulnerability attempt. It will retry on a future run.  
* **Q: Can SmartFix fix multiple vulnerabilities in one PR?**  
  * A: No, for the Early Access release, each PR addresses a single vulnerability.  
* **Q: Will SmartFix add new library dependencies?**  
  * A: Generally, SmartFix aims to use existing libraries and frameworks. We have instructed it not to make major architectural changes or add new dependencies.
