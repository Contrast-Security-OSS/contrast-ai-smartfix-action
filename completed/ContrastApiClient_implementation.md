# ContrastApiClient Implementation (Phase 2)

In Phase 2, we've migrated the functionality from the procedural code in `contrast_api.py` to the object-oriented class `ContrastApiClient`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Moved Enum Definition

The `FailureCategory` enum has been moved directly into the `ContrastApiClient` module, removing the dependency on the legacy implementation:

```python
class FailureCategory(Enum):
    INITIAL_BUILD_FAILURE = "INITIAL_BUILD_FAILURE"
    EXCEEDED_QA_ATTEMPTS = "EXCEEDED_QA_ATTEMPTS"
    QA_AGENT_FAILURE = "QA_AGENT_FAILURE"
    GIT_COMMAND_FAILURE = "GIT_COMMAND_FAILURE"
    AGENT_FAILURE = "AGENT_FAILURE"
    GENERATE_PR_FAILURE = "GENERATE_PR_FAILURE"
    GENERAL_FAILURE = "GENERAL_FAILURE"
    EXCEEDED_TIMEOUT = "EXCEEDED_TIMEOUT"
    EXCEEDED_AGENT_EVENTS = "EXCEEDED_AGENT_EVENTS"
    INVALID_LLM_CONFIG = "INVALID_LLM_CONFIG"
```

### 2. Implemented Direct API Calls

Each method that previously delegated to the legacy functions has been reimplemented to make API calls directly:

- `get_vulnerability_with_prompts`: Fetches vulnerability data and prompts from the API
- `notify_remediation_pr_opened`: Notifies about a PR being opened
- `notify_remediation_pr_merged`: Notifies about a PR being merged
- `notify_remediation_pr_closed`: Notifies about a PR being closed without merging
- `notify_remediation_failed`: Notifies about a remediation failure
- `send_telemetry_data`: Sends telemetry data to the API

### 3. Helper Methods

Added helper methods to centralize common functionality:
- `_normalize_host`: Normalizes the host URL by removing protocol prefixes
- `_get_headers`: Generates standard headers for API calls

### 4. Error Handling

Improved error handling with:
- Proper error logging
- HTTP error detection
- JSON decoding error handling

### 5. Removed Legacy Dependencies

Removed dependencies on legacy code by:
- Removing imports of legacy modules
- Implementing functionality directly in the class methods

## Benefits

1. **Better Encapsulation**: API interactions are now properly encapsulated in a single class
2. **Improved Testability**: The class can be easily mocked for testing
3. **Dependency Injection**: The client can be injected into other components
4. **Standardized Error Handling**: Consistent error handling across all API calls
5. **Cleaner Code Organization**: Related functionality grouped together

## Next Steps

The other classes in the system should now be updated to use ContrastApiClient directly instead of the legacy functions. During the future phases, the `contrast_api.py` file can eventually be removed once all code paths are using the new implementation.
