# Fixed Handler Module Import Issues

This document describes the fixes applied to the merge and closed handlers:

## Issues Fixed
1. The `closed_handler.py` and `merge_handler.py` scripts had import issues when executed directly
2. They were using relative imports that worked within the package but not when run as standalone scripts
3. They were still referencing the old `config` module instead of using the new `config_compat`

## Solutions Implemented
1. Added Python path resolution to ensure the project root is in the path:
   ```python
   # Add project root to Python path to allow absolute imports when run as script
   import os
   import sys
   project_root = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..'))
   if project_root not in sys.path:
       sys.path.insert(0, project_root)
   ```

2. Updated imports to use absolute paths:
   ```python
   from src import contrast_api
   from src.config_compat import CONTRAST_HOST, CONTRAST_ORG_ID, CONTRAST_APP_ID
   from src.utils import debug_log, extract_remediation_id_from_branch, log
   import src.telemetry_handler as telemetry_handler
   ```

3. Removed call to `config.check_contrast_config_values_exist()` which is no longer needed with the new system

4. Updated API calls to use variables from `config_compat` instead of the old `config` module

## Benefits
1. Scripts now work whether imported as modules or run directly
2. Proper use of the new configuration system
3. Consistent import structure with the rest of the codebase
4. Path resolution that works in all environments
